\subsection{\texttt{caliber.opt.Optimizer}: optimizer stage}
If you want to get more detailed information about the optimizer solution,
you can query the \texttt{Optimizer} object directly.

Information about the solution can be displayed using the following methods.

\subsubsection{\texttt{printSolutionInfo}: print information on the optimizer solution}
\texttt{printTweakInfo()}
\paragraph{Overview.} This prints information on the optimizer solution.
This is shown as a table with one row for each tweak. The columns are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{node}: The name of the node of the tweak.
	\item \texttt{paramName}: As \texttt{tweaks} in \texttt{caliber.InitOpt.addNode}.
	\item \texttt{paramValues}: The estimated value of the parameter. For rotations
		this is the axis-angle representation of the rotation. Note that extrinsic
        values are relative to their nodes' \texttt{baseM}s.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Inputs.} None.
\paragraph{Outputs.} None.
\paragraph{Remarks.}
